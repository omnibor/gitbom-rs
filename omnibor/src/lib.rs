//! OmniBOR Artifact Identifiers and Artifact Input Manifests in Rust.
//!
//! ## What is OmniBOR?
//!
//! [OmniBOR][omnibor] is a draft specification which defines two key concepts:
//!
//! - __Artifact Identifiers__: independently-reproducible identifiers for
//!   software artifacts. Use [`ArtifactId`] for these.
//! - __Artifact Input Manifests__: record the IDs of every input used in the
//!   build process for an artifact. Use [`InputManifest`] for these.
//!
//! Artifact IDs enable _anyone_ to identify and cross-reference information for
//! software artifacts without a central authority. Unlike [pURL][purl] or [CPE][cpe],
//! OmniBOR Artifact IDs don't rely on a third-party, they are _inherent
//! identifiers_ determined only by an artifact itself. They're based on
//! [Git Object Identifiers (GitOIDs)][gitoid] in both construction and choice of
//! cryptographic hash functions.
//!
//! Artifact Input Manifests allow consumers to reconstruct Artifact Dependency
//! Graphs that give _fine-grained_ visibility into how artifacts in their
//! software supply chain were made. With these graphs, consumers could
//! in the future identify the presence of exact files associated with known
//! vulnerabilities, side-stepping the complexities of matching version numbers
//! across platforms and patching practices.
//!
//! [__You can view the OmniBOR specification here.__][omnibor_spec]
//!
//! The United States Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
//! identified OmniBOR as a major candidate for software identities
//! in its 2023 report ["Software Identification Ecosystem Option
//! Analysis."][cisa_report]
